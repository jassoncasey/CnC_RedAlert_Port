# Architecture

## Minimalism (SHOULD)
- Simplest solution that works
- No premature abstraction
- No premature optimization
- Delete code over adding code

## Design Questions (SHOULD)
- What is the simplest thing that could work?
- Can this be simpler?
- What can we remove?
- Do we really need this?

## Avoid (SHOULD)
- Unnecessary abstraction layers
- Framework proliferation
- Speculative generality
- "Future-proofing" that never gets used

**Rationale:**
Minimal architecture is easier to understand,
maintain, and change. Complexity must be earned.
